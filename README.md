RRMail
======

Presentation
------------

The aim of RRMail is to allow a system administrator to configure an OS X computer to retrieve e-mail from a server, via IMAP or POP, and send it via SMTP to another one. That can be used as a forwarding service for some specific internal network. That could also be used like Microsoft POP Connector / Fetchmail / Getmail to retrieve remote e-mail hosted on an ISP e-mail server and store them on a local e-mail server.

For complete information about this project and how to use it, please check www.rrmail.fr.
